# Getting Started with Create React App

### Versions
- `node` v18.20.0
- `npm` v10.5.0

### [Atomic architecture](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) was used in the development

### Start
```
    nvm use
    npm i
    npm run start
```

### During development, I tried to comply with all styles, in some places sacrificed in favor of the general appearance of the application
